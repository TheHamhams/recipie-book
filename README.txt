Hello everyone!

Thank you for taking the time to look at my project. I am a stay at home dad who is looking change careers as my child starts going to school.

This project is a recipe book generator to practice my python skills and to try implementing a hash map. The size isn't large so I am sure just a regular array would have sufficed, but
I wanted to practice the data structure. I based it off of the hash map from codecademy tutorials, but I added a remove method to remove recipes from the hash map.

I am very interested in using best practices as soon as I can so feel free to give the program a look and a try and let me know what you think!

Please let me know what you liked and what you didn't, I welcome both positive and negative feedback so long as it is productive!
